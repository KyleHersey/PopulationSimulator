This program is written in Java. This program generates population data based upon specified parameters. Output data is generated in the form of .csv files.

MainGui.java contains the GUI, as well as the operation that occur when buttons are pressed. Operations are performed upon populations. Individuals within a population are stored as organisms.



This program outputs population to .csv files.

It will generate 1 file per population.
----IF you generate many populations, it will create many files----





.csv files can be opened in excel for data visualization and comparison


Within the .csv file
	A1 and A2 frequencies refer to allele frequency
	A1A1, A1A2, and A2A2 refer to the frequency of a combination of alleles
Excel's graph creation can be used to easily view trends in populations
